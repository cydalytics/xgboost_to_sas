## Project Description
This project demostrate a hack to deploy your trained ML models such as XGBoost and LightGBM in SAS.

## Project Details
To check the tutorial article, please click [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-folium-to-generate-choropleth-map-with-customised-tooltips-12e4cec42af2).

The package used is `m2cgen`. m2cgen(Model 2 Code Generator) - is a lightweight library which provides an easy way to transpile trained statistical models into a native code (Python, C, Java, Go, JavaScript, Visual Basic, C#, PowerShell, R, PHP, Dart, Haskell, Ruby, F#). To know more about the package, you can refer to the docunment [here](https://pypi.org/project/m2cgen/).

Data used in the scripts is [Iris dataset loaded from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html). 

## Demonstration

[Demo 1: Convert XGBoost model to VBA, then to SAS scripts](https://github.com/cydalytics/xgboost_to_sas/blob/main/Demo%201%20-%20Convert%20XGBoost%20model%20to%20VBA%2C%20then%20to%20SAS%20scripts.ipynb)


[Demo 2: Convert XGBoost model to VBA, then to SAS scripts (with missing values)](https://github.com/cydalytics/xgboost_to_sas/blob/main/Demo2%20-%20Convert%20XGBoost%20model%20to%20VBA%2C%20then%20to%20SAS%20scripts%20(with%20missing%20values).ipynb)
